- 5run comparative eval of VAE, AE, HEPA-best, BYOL
- decoder optimisation for each level of HEPA
- Make visualisations of Reconstructed using HEPA-0
- Ablation tests
    - action is 0 for all augmentations during training Essentially Autoencoder
        - which HEPA-X should i do? maybe just HEPA-0, compare to AE
    - attempt prediction without action
    -    
- Better name that generalises to pixel-space, hidden-space and latent-space prediction
